  ## Description
  This is a command-line application that will allow a quick and easy generation of a project README to get started quickly. 
  This will allow a project creator to spend more time working on finishing the project and less time creating a good README. 
  This application dynamically generates a professional README.md from a user's input using the Inquirer package. The application will be invoked with the following command: node index.js <br>
  You can also find a walkthrough video that demonstrates the functionality of the application [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TXyizn7U8UYdwsFN-C9R23ucC8Tcek_M/view?usp=sharing)
